    The city’s Michelin star restaurant scene is a million miles from sausages and sauerkraut, a fact well-known by the foodies who know Munich for its contemporary dining. With creative chefs pushing the boundaries with German gastronomy, you can expect to discover expertly crafted dishes and all types of cuisine in some outstanding settings. Highlights include the two-starred Tantris with its striking 1970s interior decor in an iconic building and the cosy-luxe Alpine lodge vibe at EssZimmer.

    When in Munich, it would be rude not enjoy a beer or two in the sunshine. Start with Paulaner am Nockherberg, which is an impressive space with its own in-house brewery. A tip if you’re a beer garden beginner; don’t try to get a round for the table! In Munich, beer is traditionally served in a one-litre stein weighing two kilos. Are you sure you can carry five? A couple of other quirks to note; you shouldn’t order a “beer”, in Munich they call it “Helles”, and just wait to find out what name the Bavarians give to anyone who finishes the last mouthful in the glass…

    Munich boasts several lush outdoor spaces and few are prettier than the sprawling Englischer Garten. Comparable in size to London’s Hyde Park and Central Park in New York, this vast green space offers a boating lake, beautiful walks and romantic dining by the water at Seehaus restaurant. A best-kept secret of the locals is the unspoilt, wild beauty of the Isar; an alpine river that runs through the city. Go for a dip if you dare, or take a picnic and enjoy the scenery.

    Munich is like a toy town of archetypal historic buildings with charming red tiled roofs, ornate carvings and spires. This means the progressive modern architecture that peppers the city stands out in pleasing, stark contrast. You’ll find angular examples of mid-century modernism, the sweeping curve of the Olympic Stadium, fractured glass at the BMW Welt and the colourful ceramic rods that make the exterior of the spectacular Museum Brandhorst.

    Art lovers will be happy to hear there’s no shortage of masterpieces to marvel at in Munich (try saying that after a stein or two). There are more galleries and museums than you could possibly fit into a short break, but highlights include; a chance to admire some of the greats at Alte Pinakothek, the relatively new MUCA, which features contemporary works by Warhol and Banksy, and the Barbara Gross Galerie, which focuses on emerging female artists.

    This years sees the opening of an incredibly exciting and meaningful project: the new DomRömer Quarter. Set in Frankfurt’s old town, this “new old town” is a painstaking and beautiful reconstruction of the magnificent Medieval buildings that would have once stood in this area. After long-since being destroyed by air raids in World War II, the 7000-square-metre area has been carefully rebuilt to offer homes, shops, squares and restaurants - bringing new life and a charming contrast of architecture to Frankfurt.

    Art and history lovers make the pilgrimage to Frankfurt for the city’s unique Museum Embankment. This lush area of green space and public parks along the river is punctuated by a whopping 26 renowned museums, 13 of which sit prettily like a string of pearls on the southern riverbank. Combine calming outdoor space with culture and don’t miss our favourites along the way - the Städel Museum (Germany’s oldest museum), the German Architecture Museum and the Museum of Applied Art.

    If you’re the type of traveller who likes to go off the beaten path to seek out a city’s up-and-coming neighbourhoods, where locals live, new coffee shops are popping up and independent boutiques are flourishing, in Frankfurt you should check out the Bahnhofsviertel, Sachsenhausen, Gallus and Nordend neighbourhoods. These are the go-to spots for creatives moving to the area, with frequent new openings. It’s in these ‘local’ enclaves that you’ll find some of the least traditional but also most edgy and unusual spots to dine and shop.

    You have to make a pit stop at the legendary Kleinmarkthalle; a famous indoor food market offering 160 stands under one roof. It’s popular for a reason and this bustling market hall is certainly not a tourist trap. If you’re looking for a memorable dining experience, try Freitagskueche on a Friday evening for inventive dishes cooked by changing special guest chefs. For something low-key and on the move, grab a fresh fish kebab from Dönerboot, which is literally a doner boat on the river Main.

    From as early as the 16th century, apple wine has been ingrained in Frankfurt’s culture. This aromatic, low-alcohol tipple is traditionally poured from a blue-grey earthenware jug which ensures that it stays cool. You’ll spot a tourist if they ask for an apple wine spritzer; purists would always drink it neat from a highball glass and some even swear by its health benefits! With several dedicated apple wine pubs in the city, you won’t struggle to lay your hand on a glass if you’re keen to try it.

    Frankfurt excels in annual festivals. In the last week of August, there’s the Museum Embankment Festival, where you’ll find live music and world foods along the riverside promenade, plus the museums themselves stay open late and put on entertainment programmes. There’s also an Apple Wine Festival (when in Rome...) and the Opera Square Festival. The most magical of all - the traditional Christmas Market - is held in the old town from late November.
