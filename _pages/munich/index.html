parent-intro: Munich has so much more to offer than a world-renowned October beer festival. For the curious city breaker looking to get under the skin of a stunning European city with an in-demand dining scene, a relaxed pace and spectacular green spaces, Munich shouldn’t be overlooked.
intro: >
  <p class="text--xl">At around a third of the size of Berlin, Bavaria’s capital city is walkable, laid-back and spilling over with charm and traditional architecture. Munich is small enough to explore in a long weekend, and with a plethora of designer boutiques and award-winning dining spots, this photogenic city offers style and substance in equal measure.</p>
  <p class="text--xl">After a smooth flight with our airline partner, Lufthansa, it’s an easy hop into the city centre with the Lufthansa Express Bus, which runs to and from the airport every 15 minutes.</p>

  intro: My name is Amadeus Danesitz and I’ve spent the last 30 years writing about my hometown.

    <p>From the food, the beer, the parties or the culture, I’ve experienced it all writing for 20 years in Prinz Magazin and Marco Polo Munich guidebooks thereafter. I’ve also written bar guides, run bar tours, and I am well versed in all things Munich.</p>
    <p>My favourite way to explore the city is with a bicycle. Munich is very bike-friendly and offers over <span class="text--bold">1,300 km of cycle paths</span>. On one side of the city you can tour along the river with a couple of great beer-garden stops, or just take a ride through the <span class="text--bold">Englischer Garten</span> – not forgetting the northern part of it which most visitors overlook. The quality of Munich’s restaurants is unbelievable and you will find something suitable for all tastes and budgets. Be it a smokehouse like <span class="text--bold">Little Wolf</span>, Asian bites at <span class="text--bold">Hutong Club</span>, or Italian bistro fare at <span class="text--bold">Due Passi</span>, Munich’s food scene is diverse and delicious. If you’re craving cocktails head for <span class="text--bold">Zum Wolf</span>, or sink back with a Pils at new brewery bars like <span class="text--bold">Paulaner am Nockherberg</span> or craft beer offerings at <span class="text--bold">Brewery Hopfenhaecker</span> – Munich certainly has no shortage of excellent watering holes.</p>
