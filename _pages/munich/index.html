intro: >
  <p class="text--xl">At around a third of the size of Berlin, Bavaria’s capital city is walkable, laid-back and spilling over with charm and traditional architecture. Munich is small enough to explore in a long weekend, and with a plethora of designer boutiques and award-winning dining spots, this photogenic city offers style and substance in equal measure.</p>
  <p class="text--xl">After a smooth flight with our airline partner, Lufthansa, it’s an easy hop into the city centre with the Lufthansa Express Bus, which runs to and from the airport every 15 minutes.</p>

          When in Munich, it would be rude not enjoy a beer or two in the sunshine. Start with Paulaner am Nockherberg, which is an impressive space with its own in-house brewery. A tip if you’re a beer garden beginner; don’t try to get a round for the table! In Munich, beer is traditionally served in a one-litre stein weighing two kilos. Are you sure you can carry five? A couple of other quirks to note; you shouldn’t order a “beer”, in Munich they call it “Helles”, and just wait to find out what name the Bavarians give to anyone who finishes the last mouthful in the glass…

          Munich boasts several lush outdoor spaces and few are prettier than the sprawling Englischer Garten. Comparable in size to London’s Hyde Park and Central Park in New York, this vast green space offers a boating lake, beautiful walks and romantic dining by the water at Seehaus restaurant. A best-kept secret of the locals is the unspoilt, wild beauty of the Isar; an alpine river that runs through the city. Go for a dip if you dare, or take a picnic and enjoy the scenery.

          Munich is like a toy town of archetypal historic buildings with charming red tiled roofs, ornate carvings and spires. This means the progressive modern architecture that peppers the city stands out in pleasing, stark contrast. You’ll find angular examples of mid-century modernism, the sweeping curve of the Olympic Stadium, fractured glass at the BMW Welt and the colourful ceramic rods that make the exterior of the spectacular Museum Brandhorst.

          Art lovers will be happy to hear there’s no shortage of masterpieces to marvel at in Munich (try saying that after a stein or two). There are more galleries and museums than you could possibly fit into a short break, but highlights include; a chance to admire some of the greats at Alte Pinakothek, the relatively new MUCA, which features contemporary works by Warhol and Banksy, and the Barbara Gross Galerie, which focuses on emerging female artists.
