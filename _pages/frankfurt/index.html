  title: Frankfurt


parent-intro: Frankfurt is a multi-faceted city that excels in both beauty and diversity. Modern Frankfurt holds a reputation as a happening centre for culture and design. This year, the city will also see the completion of the “new old town”, a stunning reconstruction project to recreate the city’s previously-destroyed medieval architecture.
intro: >
  <p class="text--xl">Frankfurt may be known internationally as a fast-paced business and finance hub with the skyscrapers to prove it, but peek behind the soaring structures and you’ll find a hip and artistic destination known by insiders as one of Europe’s hidden gems. Packed with style-led bars and restaurants, museums and diverse culture, Frankfurt is a city of contrasts, and, with the opening of its beautiful new DomRömer Quarter this year, it’s the perfect time to visit this understated metropolis. </p>

          This years sees the opening of an incredibly exciting and meaningful project: the new DomRömer Quarter. Set in Frankfurt’s old town, this “new old town” is a painstaking and beautiful reconstruction of the magnificent Medieval buildings that would have once stood in this area. After long-since being destroyed by air raids in World War II, the 7000-square-metre area has been carefully rebuilt to offer homes, shops, squares and restaurants - bringing new life and a charming contrast of architecture to Frankfurt.

          Art and history lovers make the pilgrimage to Frankfurt for the city’s unique Museum Embankment. This lush area of green space and public parks along the river is punctuated by a whopping 26 renowned museums, 13 of which sit prettily like a string of pearls on the southern riverbank. Combine calming outdoor space with culture and don’t miss our favourites along the way - the Städel Museum (Germany’s oldest museum), the German Architecture Museum and the Museum of Applied Art.

          If you’re the type of traveller who likes to go off the beaten path to seek out a city’s up-and-coming neighbourhoods, where locals live, new coffee shops are popping up and independent boutiques are flourishing, in Frankfurt you should check out the Bahnhofsviertel, Sachsenhausen, Gallus and Nordend neighbourhoods. These are the go-to spots for creatives moving to the area, with frequent new openings. It’s in these ‘local’ enclaves that you’ll find some of the least traditional but also most edgy and unusual spots to dine and shop.

          You have to make a pit stop at the legendary Kleinmarkthalle; a famous indoor food market offering 160 stands under one roof. It’s popular for a reason and this bustling market hall is certainly not a tourist trap. If you’re looking for a memorable dining experience, try Freitagskueche on a Friday evening for inventive dishes cooked by changing special guest chefs. For something low-key and on the move, grab a fresh fish kebab from Dönerboot, which is literally a doner boat on the river Main.

          From as early as the 16th century, apple wine has been ingrained in Frankfurt’s culture. This aromatic, low-alcohol tipple is traditionally poured from a blue-grey earthenware jug which ensures that it stays cool. You’ll spot a tourist if they ask for an apple wine spritzer; purists would always drink it neat from a highball glass and some even swear by its health benefits! With several dedicated apple wine pubs in the city, you won’t struggle to lay your hand on a glass if you’re keen to try it.

          Frankfurt excels in annual festivals. In the last week of August, there’s the Museum Embankment Festival, where you’ll find live music and world foods along the riverside promenade, plus the museums themselves stay open late and put on entertainment programmes. There’s also an Apple Wine Festival (when in Rome...) and the Opera Square Festival. The most magical of all - the traditional Christmas Market - is held in the old town from late November.
