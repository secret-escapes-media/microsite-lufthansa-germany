  title: Frankfurt

parent-intro: Frankfurt is a multi-faceted city that excels in both beauty and diversity. Modern Frankfurt holds a reputation as a happening centre for culture and design. This year, the city will also see the completion of the “new old town”, a stunning reconstruction project to recreate the city’s previously-destroyed medieval architecture.
intro: >
  <p class="text--xl">Frankfurt may be known internationally as a fast-paced business and finance hub with the skyscrapers to prove it, but peek behind the soaring structures and you’ll find a hip and artistic destination known by insiders as one of Europe’s hidden gems. Packed with style-led bars and restaurants, museums and diverse culture, Frankfurt is a city of contrasts, and, with the opening of its beautiful new DomRömer Quarter this year, it’s the perfect time to visit this understated metropolis. </p>

  intro: Hello fellow travellers, I’m Galia Brener and am originally from Toronto, Canada. In 2010, I founded my fashion startup Secret Pocket Society® in Frankfurt and created the world’s first feminist handbag – the “gBag”.

    <p>My love affair with this international city started when I stepped off the plane and set foot in Frankfurt’s glamorous center. From the first month living here, I nicknamed it the small cosmopolitan city with a big attitude! Frankfurt is not only Europe’s top financial hub but also offers an exciting variety of cultural experiences, including some of the best museums, galleries and fashion in Germany. With the modern skyscraper lights shining brighter than diamonds in the night sky, against the classical Altbau gallery buildings, one has the feeling of being caught between the past and the future, a truly mesmerizing experience. </p>
    <p>Discover art at SCHIRN, a modern space dedicated to artists like Basquiat and Matisse, or check out the art house cinema and museum, Duetsches Filmmuseum, hosting exhibitions like Kubrick’s 2001: 50 years of A Space Odyssey. Fashionistas should head to Goethestraße an absolute shopping paradise, with everything from the latest prêt-à-porter, to Haute Couture trends – enjoy a delectable meal and a glass of Rosé wine in the surrounding restaurants and bistros. And of course, book a private viewing at Secret Pocket Society®!</p>
